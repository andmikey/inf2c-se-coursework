\section{Introduction}

\section{Stakeholders}
We can consider the following stakeholders:
\begin{itemize}
\item {\it Auction House}: the Auction House wants to replace its existing bidding system with a software that will
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Perform existing in-house functions that the auction house currently manages manually. such taking in new bids.
    \item Open up new features to their clients (bidders, sellers, and the public) so that lots can be viewed, edited, and bid on through an online interface and without being physically present.
    \end{itemize}
\item Auctioneer: Manages auctions and oversees the bidding process by taking in new bids. They want to be aware of bids as they come in through the platform, and want to notify those involved in the bidding process as things change.
\item Buyer: Watches and bids on lots under auction. They want to see lots and their associated images, descriptions, and valuations, and want to mark interest for and bid on the lots that they want.
\item Seller: Brings lots to the auction and lists their starting prices and reserve prices. They want to be able to manage their lots and their images, descriptions, and valuations. They want to be notified about bids on their lots and told of the final prices (hammer and hammer minus seller's commision) of any lots they have sent up for auction.
\item Member of the Public: Wants to peruse the existing lots. A member of the public without an existing account needs access to seeing lots and possibly their valuations without knowing more important, buyer/seller-only details.
\item Expert: Helps to evaluate a given lot and guide the process of setting up a lot, especially its valuations. They need access similar to that of a Member of the Public, but with additional abilities to contact the seller and negotiate aspects of a lot.
\item Lot Display Professional: For lack of a better term, these are the professionals involved in taking photos and writing descriptions of a lot. They are interested in the multimedia capabilities of a lot's listing, as that will affect their process for marketing it and making attractive to potential bidders.
\item App Provider: The group responsible for maintenance of the hardware and software involved in distributing the app and keeping the app running. These may be in-house professionals for the Auction House or a another contracted agency. They are interested in the simplicity of maintaining and distributing the software and handling its interconnection between other stakeholders.
