\section{High-level design description}
We give an overview on a per-class basis, giving particular attention to deviations from our Coursework 2 specification.

\subsection{Actors}
\begin{itemize}
    \item {\bf Actor} In our CW2, this was an interface which supported
        receiving/sending messages via the MessageService. We now implement it
        as a superclass, abstracting the concept of an actor associated with
        the system. In particular, an actor has two attributes associated with
        them:
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item address (String), the messaging address. By including this in
                the superclass we ensure all actors have consistent behavior in
                how their address is set and retrieved.
            \item auctionhouse (AuctionHouse), the AuctionHouse associated with
                the actor. This is primarily to 
        \end{enumerate}
        The Actor also now has the additional viewCatalogue function, which was
        previously implemented by all actor inheritors separately. It serves
        merely as an internal convenience function to calling viewCatalogue on
        the instance of AuctionHouseImp.
    \item {\bf RegisteredUser} This now inherits from Actor, and extends it by
        requiring a specific username for each instance. This separates
        registered actors, such as Auctioneer, Client, and Seller, who need
        username, from anonymous actors, such as MemberOfPublic.
    \item {\bf Client} The client retains some functionality in Coursework 2,
        since it gives banking credentials. However, it is no longer resposible
        for handling personal details, as personal details are better put in
        RegisteredUser. Seller and Buyr inherit from Client, ensuring thatboth
        have relevant banking authentication details.
    \item {\bf Seller} This remains the same as in CW2, except that all methods
        are implemented in superclasses.
    \item {\bf Buyer} This remains the same as in CW2, except that all methods
        are implemented in superclasses. 
    \item {\bf Auctioneer} This remains largely the same as in CW2, except the
        Auctioneer now tracks if it is currently adminstering a lot. This needs
        to be tracked in order to ensure an auctioneer cannot run more than one
        auction at once. By keeping this in the Auctioneer class rather than
        storing this information in the AuctionHouse we ensure high cohesion
        and low coupling.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{AuctionHouseImp}
\begin{itemize}
    \item {\bf AuctionHouseImp} 
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Lot & Associates}
\begin{itemize}
    \item {\bf CatalogueEntry} This remains the same as in CW2.
    \item {\bf Lot} This remains the same as in CW2, except that there is no
        longer a LotInformation nor LotDescription attribute. 
    \item {\bf LotStatus} This follows our implementation in CW2, with the
        exception that the ``Pre-auction'' status has been replaced with
        ``Unsold''. This allows us to auction a lot again if it did not sell
        previously, a detail we had omitted in our CW2. 
    \item {\bf Bid} This remains the same as in CW2.
\end{itemize}

\section{Implementation decisions}
We note particular points of interest in our implementation decisions:
\begin{itemize}
    \item {\bf Abstraction of actors}: we chose to represent Buyers, Sellers,
        Auctioneers etc as classes. This allowed us to follow a strongly
        object-oriented approach, 
    \item {\bf Removal of Client methods}: in our CW2, each Client had some set
        of actions they performed, represented by a method: for example,
        `bidOnLot' for Buyer. 
    \item {\bf Consistent choice of collection classes}: we use ArrayLists and
        HashMaps where needed. {\bf Why?}
\end{itemize}
