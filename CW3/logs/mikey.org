Today:
- Reading over spec with partner
  - What do we need to do?
  - How are we going to split the work?
- Code conventions
  - Keep README? -> better to do this in project report?
  - Note to add beginning comments to file
  - public -> protected -> private
  - Group methods by functionality
  - Consistency in indentation
  - Note difference in comments vs doc comments
- Logging
  - Different uses of logging
  - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5950557/good-examples-using-java-util-logging
- JavaDoc 
  - Both familiar with it; seems reasonable
- JUnit
  - @Before / @After - start/end of each test
  - @BeforeClass / ... - start/end of all tests in given class/suite
  - Expected exceptions
  - Assertions as expected
    - assertTrue / assertFalse
    - assertEquals (with tolerance)
    - assertNull / notNull
    - assertSame / notSame
  - Naming conventions for tests
  - Tests should not be order-dependent (http://www.vogella.com/tutorials/JUnit/article.html)
  - Timeouts
  - Disable tests by platform
  - https://www.michael-thomas.com/tech/java/junit/junit4_survival_guide.htm
- Add tests to MoneyTest
