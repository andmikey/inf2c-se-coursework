Covered specifications
    How to split work
        Resolved to work largely at same time and divvy work as we go
        General development by Dylan
        Testing mostly covered by Mikey
    Potential pitfalls
        Test myopia (assuming that just because your tests pass, the code works)
        Getting too invested in one solution before considering drawbacks
        God functions
            With AuctionHouseImp, it is inevitable we will have a large central
            class with lots of logic
            However, we can ameliorate that by keeping functions well divided
            in terms of size and purpose internally

Went over general utilities and tools
    Code conventions
        Indent with 4 spaces, as both of us prefer to
        Keep comments to file
        Order variables and methods correctly
            Public, then protected, then private
        Note difference in comments vs doc comments
    JavaDoc 
    JUnit
        @Before & @After            are per test
        @BeforeClass & @AfterClass  are per suite
        Assertions are pretty identical to NodeJS assert
