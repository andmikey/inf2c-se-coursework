\section{Introduction}
We provide a software design for an auction house system, codenamed {\it Auctionista}. Our design is consistent with the requirements design undertaken in Coursework 1. We provide UML class models for the key actors involved in the system, and sequence diagrams and behavior descriptions for use-cases identified in Coursework 1. For further details, please refer to the specification for Coursework 2.

\subsection{High-level description}
\noindent Firstly, an overview on a per-concept basis:
\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf Actor: } The actors in the system --- Seller, Buyer, Auctioneer, MemberOfPublic --- are represented as implementations of the Actor interface. This means that:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item By separating interface and implementation, we follow good design principles.
  \item The Actor class ensures a consistent interface for message exchange using the MessageService singleton.
  \item We can encapsulate the handling of messages of different kinds on a per-object basis, making it easy to maintain and add more message types as needed.
  \item As each implementation of Actor will have a different way of handling various receiveMessage() instances, we leave these up to the classes to implement, rather than specifying them in Actor. This ensures good cohesion. 
  \end{itemize}
\item {\bf MessagingService: } Messages are sent and received only for objects which implement the Actor interface. In the case of this system, all messages passed around the system will relate to a lot. This means that we only define methods for Actors to receive messages which pertain to a given Lot and some change in status (see point below). However, we can easily create new receiveMessage() functions for Actors which take different parameters. 
\item {\bf LotUpdateMessage: } This class specifies all the possible state-changes a lot may undertake. By providing these states as an enum, we ensure maintainability and modularisation: by adding a new possible state to the enum we update all the classes which receive messages pertaining to lots.
\item {\bf RegisteredUser: } This represents superclass the actors who have an account on the system, allowing us to separate them from members of the public, who we assume to not have accounts. Using inheritance, we ensure consistent behavior for these users. Currently, this is only ensuring that all have a username: however, this is easily extensible to also include, for example, passwords and two-factor-authentication.
\item {\bf Client: } A subclass of RegisteredUser, this represents Sellers and Buyers. These two actors use the system in a similar way, so we ensure a similar implementation by combining them into a Client superclass. In particular, we ensure that Sellers and Buyers both have personal and banking details set for their accounts. We considered having both Buyer and Seller inherit from RegisteredUser, as Auctioneer does, but decided that the behavior of these two classes needed to be enforced to be similar enough to warrant a superclass. 
\item {\bf BankingDetails: } This class is excluded from the diagram for brevity: we treat it as analogous to the PersonalDetails class, containing the user's account and authorization details, as needed to make transactions. We chose to separate BankingClass from RegisteredUser for loose coupling and high cohesion of the components. This way, RegisteredUser does not need to care if the implementation of BankingDetails changes. This could be particularly useful if we decide we need to validate banking details before a user can register: these changes can be handled within the BankingDetails class, which ensures high cohesion as logically bank validation logic may not necessarily belong in a User class. 
\item {\bf Seller: } This represents a Seller actor. We note the following:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item An instance of the Seller class has some $n$ lots associated with it, the lots it owns. It makes sense to have this stored as an attribute of the seller: it allows for faster retrieval of the lots associated with a seller, rather than the alternative of polling all lots in the system to check which belong to that seller. 
  \item A Seller adding a lot calls the addLot method on itself. This method then calls AuctionHouse.addLot, which creates the lot and adds it to the AuctionHouse's list of lots. This is then returned to the Seller who adds it to the list of their lotsOwned.
  \item We note that the addLot method only needs the LotInformation (described later) and a unique ID associated with the lot, which as per the specification is given to the Seller ahead of time. All other information about a lot can be inferred. However, we note that there is no way given on how an auctioneer is assigned to a lot: we assume this is handled by the auction house staff themselves and do not include how this may be done in the class diagram.
  \item The receiveMessage method only includes support for when the LotUpdateMessage is LotSold, wherein the system informs the Seller that their lot has been sold. We assume other LotUpdateMessages are disregarded, but for the purposes of maintainability, maintain the ability to receive them: for example, it may be desirable in the future for the Seller to be informed when bids are placed on their lot. 
  \end{itemize}
\item {\bf Buyer: } We note the following:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Like the Seller class, we maintain a list of lots associated with the Buyer. This has the same benefits of not needing to poll all lots to see which lots the Buyer has marked themselves as interested in every time we wish to display these lots.
  \item As per the specification, we have a viewCatalogue() function which returns a List of CatalogueEntries, for the user interface to handle as needed. By separating the retrieval logic from the display logic, we ensure high cohesion. 
  \item The bidOnLot() method only takes an argument of Bid, as the lot it is associated with can be inferred from the bid object.
  \item Both bidOnLot() and markInterestInLot() call the AuctionHouse methods makeBid() and noteInterest methods respectively. This means the Buyer object only communicates with the AuctionHouse singleton, which delegates messages and updates its own status as needed; particularly, it means the Buyer class does not need to be concerned with the interfaces other objects provide and how this may change. 
  \item The receiveMessage() method includes support for all three LotUpdateMessage options:
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item BidPlacedOnLot, so the Buyer is informed when a lot they are interested in has had a bid placed on it;
      \item LotOnAuction, when the lot a Buyer is interested in opens for auction;
      \item LotSold, when the lot a Buyer is interested in is sold. From the Lot object itself we can work out if the Buyer was the winner of this Lot, and change the information presented to the end-user as needed. We originally had three options for this --- LotSold, LotSoldAndWon, LotSoldAndLost --- for the seller, winning buyer, and losing buyers respectively, but this information can be inferred from the Lot object so including separate enums for this is redundant. 
    \end{enumerate}
  \end{itemize}
\item {\bf Auctioneer: } We note the following:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item An Auctioneer has a set of AssignedLots, which is updated by an implied getter / setter not mentioned on the class diagram for brevity. 
    \item The Auctioneer has the ability to open and close a lot, delegating the logic of this to the AuctionHouse class. 
    \item When closing a lot, the auctioneer does not need to specify a winning bid as this can be inferred from the Lot object at the time of the auction closing. 
    \item The Auctioneer is informed when a bid is placed on a lot they are in charge of (BidPlacedOnLot). 
  \end{itemize}
\item {\bf Member of Public: } This user has very restricted privileges, being able only to view catalogue entries. We note that it is an implementation of the Actor interface: this is primarily for maintainability purposes, in case it is decided that members of the public may be allowed to perform more actions --- for example, marking interest in a lot and receiving updates when bids are placed on it.
\item {\bf Lot: } 
\item {\bf LotInformation: }
\item {\bf LotUpdateMessage: }
\item {\bf LotStatus: }
\item {\bf Bid: }
\item {\bf BidType: }
\item {\bf Auctionhouse: }
\item {\bf Status: }
\end{itemize}
